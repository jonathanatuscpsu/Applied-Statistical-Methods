Welcome to Applied Statistical Methods (BANA 7051)! The main objective of this course is to provide you with the proper foundation to analyze and forecast time series data in the professional setting. This means that in addition to forecasting into the future and evaluating such forecasts we will discuss other topics to prepare you for your journey as an analyst. While covering core concepts like univariate and multivariate forecasting/evaluation of forecasts are critical, I believe we should also cover topics like approaching a forecasting a problem, wrangling with time series data/objects, advanced topics like neural networks for time series, hierarchical data and practical issues when approaching a problem and implementing a solution.
